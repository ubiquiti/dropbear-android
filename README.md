Android Dropbear
=========

A patch set and script to download and cross-compile Dropbear SSH server for use on Android with password authentication.
As the 64-bit binaries don't seem to work reliably, this project is configured to compile 32-bit binaries
using the Android NDK toolchain.

Generated binares will all be PIE (position indepedent executable) binaries as it is required on Android 5 (L/ollipop).

If building for android < 4.1 then before building, issue:
```
export DISABLE_PIE=1
```

Building Dropbear for Android
----

The process consists of just four parts:  
1) Specify the version of Dropbear you'd like to download and crosscompile. Open build-android-dropbear.sh and change the value of ``VERSION`` at the top, which defaults to ``2018.76``  
2) Build your standalone android toolchain.  
See the android developer site for more info: https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/standalone_toolchain.html
3) Export your toolchain's location:
```
export TOOLCHAIN=/path/to/standalone/toolchain
```
4) If you are using NDK r19 or later, you may also specify the compiler (notice the API version number):
```
export COMPILER=${TOOLCHAIN}/bin/armv7a-linux-androideabi23-clang
```
5) Run the build script:
```
./build-dropbear-android.sh
```

Generated binaries will be outputted to ``{android dropbear repo directory}/target/arm``


Customizations
----

Much of the project is pre-configured with sane defaults, but if you'd like to customize the behavior of Dropbear for Android, here are a few tips.
1) To change/configure most options, look in and modify the following files as appropriate:  
	a) default_options.h  
	b) sysoptions.h  
	c) config.h  

For instance, to change the port Dropbear runs on or to change the default location in which Dropbear tries to generate keys, edit ``default_options.h`` and modify the respective values.  
  
Basic usage
----
Dropbear for Android adds a few special flags to Dropbear:  
- A: signifies Android mode and allows for password authentication in the absence of the ```crypt()``` lib
- G: allows us to specify the GID dropbear should run as  
- U: allows us to specify the UID dropbear should run as  
- N: specify the login username for the session  
- T: specify the authentication key for the session  

A typical usecase would be:  
```
./dropbear -d /path/to/dropbear_dss_host_key -r /path/to/dropbear_rsa_hostkey -p 10022 -P /path/to/dropbear.pid -R -A -N user -C password -U u0_aXX -G u0_aXX
```

The above command will run the Dropbear server with password authentication enabled for the user 'user' with password 'password' and will attempt to run as u0_aXX and in that group. More information can be found by issuing:  
  
```
./dropbear --help
````
